# Chris Biscardi's dotfiles

This is probably not usable out-of-the box for you, but could be used
to take pieces of code from for your own use.

## emacs

My [Emacs](https://github.com/christopherbiscardi/docker-emacs) lives
in the docker image `biscarch/emacs` which is auto-built from the git
repo
[docker-emacs](https://github.com/christopherbiscardi/docker-emacs). There
is a more up-to-date
[emacs config](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/docker-emacs/blob/master/emacs.d/config.org)
in that repo since it is where I use emacs the most.

I use the `snippets` directory here for yasnippets.

## setup

[setup](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/dotfiles/blob/master/setup)
contains setup commands for `zsh` and git subcommands( `git ll` and
`git lg`).
