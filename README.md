# Chris Biscardi's dotfiles

This is probably not usable out-of-the box for you, but could be used
to take pieces of code from for your own use.

## emacs

I use the `snippets` directory here for yasnippets.

## setup

[setup](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/dotfiles/blob/master/setup)
contains setup commands for `zsh` and git subcommands( `git ll` and
`git lg`).
